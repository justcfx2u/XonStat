0) preparation
==============
# create system user “xonstat” with random password. it will be used to run the website
sudo adduser xonstat  

1) feeder 
===========================
# the feeder is a nodejs application which connects to QL servers, 
# optionally saves match data as .json.gz files and 
# optionally reformats and forwards the data to the XonStat python HTTP server

sudo apt-get install git              # eventually already installed
sudo apt-get install nodejs           # eventually already installed
sudo apt-get install npm              # eventually already installed 
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node   # ignore error if there is already a "node" command

# as xonstat user
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/PredatH0r/XonStat.git
cd XonStat/feeder
npm install zmq
npm install graceful-fs
npm install log4js
npm install q
npm install request
mkdir ql-match-jsons

# edit cfg.json for your server list. 
# server entries have the format "ip:port/password". hostnames are not allowed.
# the config file can even be edited while the feeder is running. it will automatically re-load the config.
# you can change the logLevel to DEBUG to see any sort of activity on the QL zmq stats ports
node feeder.node.js >feeder.log &


2) database
============
sudo apt-get install postgresql
git clone https://github.com/antzucaro/xonstatdb.git

the following steps are described on https://github.com/antzucaro/xonstatdb:

# as root user
su - postgres
createuser -P xonstat  					# use "xonstat" as password or modify "development.ini" later with the correct password
psql
CREATE DATABASE xonstatdb WITH ENCODING='UTF8' OWNER=xonstat CONNECTION LIMIT=-1;
\q
exit

# as xonstat user
cd ~/xonstatdb
psql -U xonstat xonstatdb
CREATE SCHEMA xonstat AUTHORIZATION xonstat;
CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;   				# ignore error/warning
\i build/build_full.sql
\i ../XonStat/sql/qlstats-init.sql      # this is an extra-step to modify the xonstat database for QL
\q

3) python based website
=======================
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.4
sudo pip install pastescript
# as xonstat user
cd ~xonstat/XonStat
export PYTHONHOME=/home/xonstat/XonStat/lib/python
python setup.py install --home=/home/xonstat/XonStat

# before starting the web server you can edit development.ini e.g. to set the number of required players per team
paster serve development.ini >xonstat.log

now you can connect to http://<machine-ip>:8080

4) final notes
==============
The feeder sends match data to <machine-ip>:8080/submission.py
There is no built-in security feature that would prevent anyone from the outside calling this script and submit bogus data.
One was of handling this is use a front-facing tool like nginx which forwards all external requests from port 80 to internal port 8080, but blocks the /submission.py URL from external access.
The feeder can still connect using the loopback IP http://127.0.0.1/submission.py
